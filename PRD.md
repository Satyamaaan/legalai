# Product Requirements Document: Legal Document Translator

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Problem Statement
Legal professionals and individuals dealing with legal documents in Gujarati often face challenges in accurately translating these documents into other languages (e.g., English) while preserving the original formatting and structure. Manual translation is time-consuming, expensive, and prone to errors, especially with complex legal terminology and layouts. Existing generic translation tools may not adequately handle the nuances of legal text or maintain document integrity.

### 1.2. Proposed Solution
A specialized software application that takes a PDF document containing Gujarati legal text as input. The application will:
1.  Extract text from the PDF, making a best effort to preserve the original formatting and structural elements (e.g., paragraphs, headings, lists).
2.  Translate the extracted Gujarati text into a user-specified target language using a robust translation engine.
3.  Present the translated text to the user, aiming to reflect the original document's layout and formatting as closely as possible.

### 1.3. Goals/Objectives
*   To provide a fast and efficient way to translate Gujarati legal documents.
*   To significantly reduce the manual effort and cost associated with legal document translation.
*   To improve the accuracy of translations by leveraging specialized AI.
*   To maintain the structural integrity and key formatting elements of the original PDF in the translated output.
*   To offer a user-friendly interface for uploading PDFs and receiving translated content.

## 2. Target Audience

*   Lawyers and legal firms dealing with multilingual legal matters.
*   Paralegals and legal assistants.
*   Businesses and individuals requiring translation of legal contracts, agreements, and other official documents.
*   Government agencies or NGOs working with legal documentation in Gujarati.

## 3. Product Features

### 3.1. Core Features (Minimum Viable Product - MVP)
*   **PDF Upload:** Allow users to upload PDF files containing Gujarati text.
*   **Text Extraction:**
    *   Utilize the `multilingual-pdf2text` library (or a similar robust solution) to extract text from the PDF.
    *   Focus on extracting text from selectable PDFs first.
    *   Employ Tesseract OCR for scanned PDFs or PDFs with non-selectable text, specifically configured for Gujarati.
    *   Capture basic structural information (e.g., paragraph breaks).
*   **Language Selection:**
    *   Source Language: Primarily Gujarati (potentially auto-detect).
    *   Target Language: User selectable (e.g., English - India).
*   **Translation:**
    *   Integrate with Sarvam AI's translation API.
    *   Implement logic to handle the API's character limits (e.g., chunking text while trying to preserve sentence/paragraph context).
*   **Formatted Text Output:**
    *   Display the translated text.
    *   Attempt to reapply basic formatting captured during extraction (e.g., paragraph breaks, bold/italics if feasible with the chosen extraction library's capabilities).
    *   Provide an option to copy the translated text.
*   **User Interface:** Simple and intuitive web interface for file upload, language selection, and viewing results.

### 3.2. Future/Potential Features (Post-MVP)
*   **Advanced Formatting Preservation:** More sophisticated retention and reapplication of formatting (tables, lists, font styles, text positioning).
*   **Multiple File Uploads/Batch Processing:** Allow users to translate multiple documents at once.
*   **Output Formats:** Option to download the translated document in various formats (e.g., .txt, .docx, or even a reconstructed PDF).
*   **Glossary/Terminology Management:** Allow users to define specific translations for recurring legal terms.
*   **Version History:** Keep track of translated documents.
*   **Collaboration Features:** Allow multiple users to work on translations.
*   **Support for More Source Languages:** Expand beyond Gujarati.
*   **Direct PDF Annotation/Highlighting:** Show translated text alongside the original in a viewer.
*   **Confidence Scores:** Provide an indication of translation quality or areas that might need review.

## 4. Technical Considerations

### 4.1. Key Technologies
*   **PDF Text Extraction:** Python, `multilingual-pdf2text` library, Tesseract OCR (with Gujarati language pack).
*   **Translation Service:** Sarvam AI Translation API.
*   **Backend:** Python (e.g., Flask/Django) for handling API calls, file processing.
*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (potentially using a framework like React, Vue, or Angular, and UI component libraries like Shadcn/ui for building the interface).

### 4.2. Key Challenges
*   **Accuracy of OCR for Gujarati:** Ensuring high-quality text extraction from scanned or image-based PDFs.
*   **Preserving Complex Formatting:** PDFs are presentation-first; accurately extracting and reapplying complex layouts (tables, columns, intricate styling) is a major challenge. The MVP will likely focus on basic formatting.
*   **Translation Nuances for Legal Text:** Ensuring the translation maintains the precise legal meaning. Sarvam AI's capabilities for legal domain specificity will be important.
*   **Sarvam AI API Limitations:** Handling the 1000-character input limit per request effectively, especially for large documents, without losing context or breaking formatting.
*   **Scalability:** Designing the system to handle potentially large PDF files and concurrent users.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling for PDF parsing issues, API failures, etc.

## 5. Success Metrics

*   **User Adoption Rate:** Number of active users/sign-ups.
*   **Task Completion Rate:** Percentage of users successfully translating a document.
*   **Translation Accuracy (Qualitative):** User feedback on the quality and accuracy of translations.
*   **Formatting Preservation (Qualitative):** User feedback on how well the output matches the original document's structure.
*   **Processing Time:** Average time taken to translate a document of a certain size.
*   **Reduction in Manual Effort (User Reported):** Feedback on time saved compared to manual methods.
*   **API Usage Costs:** Monitoring costs associated with the Sarvam AI API.
